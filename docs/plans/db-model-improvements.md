# DB model improvements: critique and target design

Status: **proposal** (2026-07-23; revised same day after the adversarial
review in [data-model-review.md](data-model-review.md) — the review's
findings against this document, F1–F11 and X3/X12/X13/X21, are each
either incorporated or explicitly deferred below, and every revised
claim/DDL was re-verified against store.py/schema.py and a copy of the
real 8E0C database on SQLite 3.53.3; per-item "Verified:" lines record
the command or query). Review of the analysis-database model at
schema/store/frames depth, and a target design reachable by incremental
migration. Companion to [db-schema.md](../reference/db-schema.md) (what is)
— this document is *what should change and why*. Nothing here is
implemented; every proposal states its migration path.

Design goals, in priority order:

1. **Live/serve mode readiness** — incremental updates while the game runs
   (the watch/analyzer-split direction from the parked `live-db-spike`
   branch), repeated cheap queries against changing state, readers and the
   writer coexisting.
2. **Ad-hoc analytical SQL** — the ontology should read naturally in
   hand-written queries: game-domain names, obvious join paths, no pandas
   required for common questions.

Constraints kept throughout: SQLite, `pd.read_sql` consumption, slim
dependencies, no ORM, no engine swap. Event history is preserved by every
proposal — **no change below loses history** (a few explicitly discard
derivable data that rebuilds from the next run, which is stated inline).

---

## 1. Current-model critique

Each finding cites the code it lives in. Severity is about how much the
finding fights the two design goals, not code quality — most of these are
deliberate, documented decisions that made sense for a one-shot batch
pipeline and stop making sense for live mode.

### C1. World state is single-snapshot: no trends, nothing to serve incrementally

`store.write_snapshot` deletes **all** W-table rows before every import
(`store.py:192-193`, comment: "phases 1-3 keep only the latest snapshot;
retention is phase 5"). The `save` table accumulates one row per import —
but only until the next schema bump, which wipes it (C12/review F1); even
between bumps it is the *only* record older imports happened —
`DISTINCT save_id` in `component` is always one value. The live-db-spike
inventory
(`live-db-features.md` on branch `live-db-spike`) measured the
consequence directly: 46 analyzed runs, zero cross-snapshot world data;
every trend-shaped feature (territory pressure, fleet attrition, market
price evolution, empire net worth) is blocked. For live mode this is the
single most limiting property: a watcher that analyzes every autosave
produces a dense stream of snapshots and the schema throws each one away.

Full snapshot retention is the wrong fix (≈120 MB × N). The right fix is
**append-only aggregate history** written per snapshot — see T4.

### C2. The current-snapshot concept is a repeated idiom, not a name

Every snapshot-scoped view filters with `(SELECT MAX(save_id) FROM save)`
(`schema.py:518-598`, seven occurrences across six of the eight views —
the two E-flavored views, `v_stock_delta` and `v_station_drones`,
correctly don't; corrected per review F5, verified with
`grep -n "MAX(save_id)" src/x4analyzer/db/schema.py`) and `frames.py`
interpolates the same subquery as `_CUR` into ~20 query strings
(`frames.py:124`).
Hand-written SQL must know and repeat the trick; there is no
`current_save` to join. Cosmetic, but it is the first thing every ad-hoc
query trips over. See T1.

### C3. The entity registry is not joined to the world it describes

The registry is the model's best idea — surrogate identity over recycled
codes and remapping runtime ids — and the **snapshot tables cannot reach
it**. `component` carries no `entity_id` (`schema.py:115-134`);
db-schema.md says it outright: "Event rows are stamped with entity ids at
merge time; `component` rows are not (join through code+class or via the
event tables)". The cause is pipeline ordering: `write_snapshot` runs
before `update_entity_registry` (`analyze.py:32-33`), and the mapping the
registry returns (`store.py:389+`) is used only to stamp event rows
(`merge_events`, `store.py:524+`).

Consequences: "show this station's stock history" requires a
code+class join that is exactly the unreliable join the registry exists
to replace; the entity graveyard cannot say "which of these is on the map
right now" without string matching; fleet edges, cargo, offers, orders —
every per-object W table — key on runtime ids that mean nothing across
snapshots. This is the highest-leverage single change available: one
column turns `entity` into the hub of the whole schema. See T2.

### C4. Event-stream coverage lives in `meta` strings and an unexplained column

Coverage/provenance — *which time ranges does the history actually
cover* — is a first-class analytical concept (every rate denominator
needs it, every gap must be visible) but is smeared across:

- `meta.trade_tx_window_start` / `meta.stock_event_window_start`,
  stringly-typed (`store.py:746-748`), read back with a raw `meta` lookup
  in `frames.py:566-571`;
- the `epoch` column on `trade_tx`/`stock_event`, which marks gaps but has
  no table describing what an epoch spans;
- `log_entry`, which has per-category windows (`store.py:634-643`) and
  **no epoch column at all** — a coverage gap in the logbook is silently
  invisible.

Ad-hoc SQL cannot answer "what stretches of the playthrough do I have
trade data for?" without window-aggregating the event tables. See T3.

### C5. `v_stock_delta` partitions on a string concat and scans unindexed

The view partitions its LAG by
`COALESCE(owner_faction || '|' || owner_code, owner_id)`
(`schema.py:542-551`) — a synthesized text identity — although 99.3 % of
rows carry `owner_entity` (measured in `live-db-features.md`), the exact
durable identity the registry mints. And the only stock index is
`idx_stock ON stock_event(owner_id, ware, time)` (`schema.py:500`), which
serves neither the analysis nor the merge — `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` shows
`SCAN stock_event` for the delta view's window scan and for the merge's
time-keyed `SELECT MAX(time)` / `DELETE … WHERE time >=` alike (verified
on the 8E0C copy; this also corrects the review's X12 target,
db-schema.md's claim that the index serves the view). Per-station history
was measured at 30 ms/station in the spike — via the `owner_code` text
fallback, not durable identity (corrected per review F7; the
`owner_entity` variant was never separately timed) — and the full delta
scan at 888 ms, the one interactive-latency failure in the spike's
endpoint table. See T6 + the index in T2.

### C6. Frames re-derives in pandas what the schema already knows

`analysis/frames.py` contains several blocks that are relational work
done in pandas, per run, invisible to SQL consumers:

- **Trade display-name re-resolution and proxy redirect**
  (`frames.py:456-513`): re-resolving each party's current name (entity
  registry first, then latest-name-per-code, then stored), then melting
  the wide `trade_tx` columns into commander-redirected `buyer.*` /
  `seller.*` / `*.proxy.*` columns. This is a view — the "Executed by"
  attribution rule is a `COALESCE(cmdr_entity, entity)`. See T6/v_trade.
- **`global_trades` enrichment** (`frames.py:566-616`): mapping
  `owner_id` → universe columns, falling back to `removed_object`, a
  dagger flag, a faction-short label, an unnamed-station synthesized name.
  Three-way identity resolution done in pandas maps, again per run. See
  T6/v_stock_flow.
- **Faction standing pivot** (`frames.py:624-651`): effective standing =
  base + boosters clamped to [−1, 1] — a three-line GROUP BY. See T7.
  [2026-07-31: superseded — effective standing is the booster when
  present, replacing the base; E-145, faction-relations-model.md. The
  additive law described here was falsified (E-083).]
- **Resource-area classification** (`frames.py:212-283`): the
  live/full/respawning/never state machine needs `(level, ware) →
  (capacity, respawndelay)` from `ref.region_yields`
  (`gamedata/refdata.py:142`) — reference data that exists as a packaged
  CSV (`regionyields.csv`, csv-reference.md) but was never loaded into
  the DB (`schema.py:85-88`), so the classification *cannot* be SQL
  today. See T9.
- **Station rollups** (`frames.py:336-366, 380-388`): workforce pivots,
  crew sums, module counts, the hull/mass estimate (`modules × 250_000`,
  `frames.py:333-334`) — assembled in pandas each run, unavailable to a
  `SELECT`. See T8.
- **`station_types`** (`frames.py:137-176`) is computed **twice per
  run** — once via `station_types_from_db` before the merge
  (`analyze.py:35`) and again inside `build_frames`
  (`frames.py:327-328`).

None of these are wrong for a dashboard build; all of them mean the
serve-mode API and any hand-written query get a dumber database than the
dashboard does.

### C7. Fleet-edge resolution is implemented twice

`write_snapshot` resolves follower→commander from
`save.commander_links`/`save.subordinate_conns` (`store.py:213-231`), and
`_player_edges` does the same matching again, independently, for merge
attribution (`store.py:596-610`) — same algorithm, different filters,
diverging warning behavior (the first warns on conflicts, the second
silently `setdefault`s). `frames.wings` then re-filters the table to
player-owned in pandas (`frames.py:295-299`). One resolution, one table,
one player-filtered view. See T2/T8.

### C8. Import-run and snapshot are conflated in `save`

`save` gets a row per *import*, not per *distinct save*: the spike DB had
46 rows for 2 distinct saves. Any series keyed on `save` (the
player-money series, and every aggregate-history table T4 proposes) is
polluted by dashboard-dev reruns. There is no is-rerun signal and no
distinct-snapshot view. And the pollution problem is the *lesser* defect
of keying on `save` — the table doesn't even survive schema bumps (C12).
See T5 (which now requires T0).

### C9. View lifecycle fights read-only consumers

Views are dropped and recreated at **every connect**
(`store.py:82-85`) — a write. The serve prototype had to work around
this by re-declaring every view as TEMP on its read-only connections
(`live-db-plan.md`: "DBs opened mode=ro with TEMP view definitions"),
duplicating the definitions. A live-mode reader should be able to open
`mode=ro` and see current views. Also missing for live mode: WAL journal
mode (writer blocks readers under the default rollback journal),
`busy_timeout`. See T10.

### C10. Naming fights the domain

- `module` holds **build-plan entries**, not modules — the name is the
  direct cause of the "capacity nearly 2× reality" gotcha that CLAUDE.md
  has to warn about (unbuilt plan entries counted as modules); the
  catalog table is `module_ref` and the capacity table `modcap`.
- Suffix conventions are mixed: `sector_ref`/`cluster_ref`/`ship_ref`/
  `module_ref` vs bare `ware`/`faction`/`gate`/`recipe`/`modcap`.
- `faction_meta.account` is the one raw-cents money column in a schema
  whose stated convention is `_cr` credits (db-schema.md § Conventions;
  `schema.py:289-294`).
- `trade_offer.object_id` keeps `''` instead of NULL — the one deliberate
  empty-string exception (`store.py:296-300`).
- `trade_tx.ware`/`stock_event.ware` use `''` for absent
  (`store.py:686,697`) against the schema-wide NULL convention.
- `npc` is player-employees-only but the name doesn't say so.

Individually trivial; together they are why ad-hoc SQL against this DB
needs the reference doc open. See T11.

### C11. Small defects worth folding into any migration pass

- `log_entry.interaction` is never populated — loader reads `interaction`
  where the save writes `interact` (db-schema.md § Defined-but-never-
  populated; `schema.py:350`). The value survives in `raw_attrs` JSON and
  is backfillable with `json_extract`. See T12.
- Schema resets drop only *current* table names (`store.py:70-74`), so
  renamed tables become zombies — the reference DB carries
  `station_drones` + its index (db-schema.md § Schema versioning). See
  T13.
- `removed_object` rows record no provenance of when they were first
  merged (their save-side `time` attr doesn't exist in v9, so the DB-side
  arrival save is the only timestamp obtainable). See T13.

### C12. Schema bumps drop `save` and `meta`; the migration chain has holes

(From review F1/F2/X13 — this critique was missing from the first draft
and its absence broke half the target design.) `_ensure_schema` drops
**every** table not in `EVENT_TABLES` on a `SCHEMA_VERSION` mismatch —
`save` and `meta` included (`store.py:70-74`; `EVENT_TABLES` at
`schema.py:28-29` lists six E tables only). So the import log resets on
every bump: the 8E0C DB the spike measured at 46 `save` rows on
2026-07-21 holds 2 today, both post-v10, while `entity.first_seen` still
shows 13 distinct import times (verified:
`SELECT COUNT(*) FROM save; SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT first_seen) FROM
entity;` → 2 / 13). Anything that keys `save_id` into a table that
outlives bumps — every A-table T4 proposes, T3's `updated_save_id`,
T13's `first_save_id` — silently points into recycled ids after the
first bump, and `meta` keys (T13's `managed_tables`, T3's seeded
windows) are dropped by the very code path that would read them.

Separately, the E-migration walk (`while version in EVENT_MIGRATIONS`,
`store.py:66-69`) only works for DBs on the explicit chain:
`NEXT_VERSION` maps 1→2→3→4 (`schema.py:75`) and nothing beyond, while
`SCHEMA_VERSION` is "10". A DB at an off-chain version skips every
migration — and one exists: the 559 h playthrough's DB is at v5
(verified: `sqlite3 x4_94062A45….sqlite "SELECT value FROM meta WHERE
key='schema_version'"` → 5). Any future E-migration keyed at the current
version (T3's backfill, T12's UPDATE, T13's ALTER) would silently not
run for it, after which explicit-column INSERTs crash. Fix: **T0**, a
precondition for T3/T4/T5/T12/T13.

### C13. Stale-save merges destroy event history — the current model CAN lose history

(From review F8; same code finding as the review's db-schema F4.)
`_merge_window` executes `DELETE FROM {table} WHERE time >= mintime`
unconditionally (`store.py:736`): feeding an *older* save of the same
playthrough — one `--save` typo, or exactly the out-of-order autosave
delivery a live-mode watcher invites — wipes every event row newer than
that save's window start and replaces it with the shorter window. Only
the entity registry has a high-water guard (`store.py:412-417`). The
first draft's framing "no change below loses history" never noticed the
*current* model can. Fix: **T14**; empirical proof of the destruction is
review backlog item 3.

### C14. `write_reference` rewrites every R table + the full textdb every run

(From review F9.) `write_reference` does `DELETE FROM {table}` + full
re-insert for all nine R tables and `text` on every import
(`store.py:157-167`) — irrelevant for a one-shot batch run, real write
churn under a watcher analyzing every autosave (goal 1). Fix: folded
into T10.

## 2. Ontology assessment

Does the schema carry the concepts the analysis is *about*? Concept by
concept:

| Concept | Where it lives today | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Entity lifecycle** | `entity` + `entity_event` | **Good core, isolated.** Lifespan bounds, capture/rename events, recycled-slot semantics — the best-modeled concept in the DB. But it is reachable only from event rows (C3), and lifecycle *state transitions* are half table-columns (`gone_time`/`gone_reason`, reopening resets them losing the fact a disappearance ever happened) and half events. |
| **Ownership** | `component.owner` (now), `entity.owner` (current) + `captured` events (history) | **Adequate.** Ownership history exists per entity; faction-level rollups (territory) don't — see below. |
| **Station economics** | Smeared: `cargo`, `trade_offer`, `workforce`, `module`, `build_resource`, `station_storage`, `station_munition` + pandas rollups (C6) | **Present but unassembled.** Every ingredient exists; no station-level object a query can `SELECT` from. No history of any of it (C1). |
| **Market offers** | `trade_offer` (snapshot only) | **Half-modeled.** The offer *book* of the current instant exists; offer/price *evolution* is discarded every import. NPC↔NPC trades are structurally absent from the save's economylog (savegame-structure.md § economylog: owner-only stock flavor) — offer history is the only obtainable NPC price signal, and we throw it away. |
| **Trade history** | `trade_tx` (player-involved, entity-linked, commander-attributed) | **Good**, with the display/attribution logic trapped in frames (C6) and the party model denormalized into 23 columns — tolerable, but only a view makes it queryable in domain terms. |
| **Stock flows** | `stock_event` + `v_stock_delta` | **Good data, weak access path** (C5). This is half the DB by bytes and the only universe-wide economic signal. |
| **Fleet hierarchy** | `fleet_edge` (runtime ids, snapshot), `v_fleet` closure, `*_cmdr_*` frozen into trade rows | **Snapshot-only and id-fragile.** No durable (entity-level) fleet membership; merge-time freezing into trade rows is the right call for attribution but is the *only* fleet history that exists. |
| **Sector territory** | Nowhere. `component.sector_macro` + owner enables the 9.5 ms presence query (spike), but no table/view names the concept; the map computes it in Python per build | **Missing.** Highest-value absent concept, and the cheapest history to keep (T4). |
| **Coverage/provenance of evidence** | `epoch` columns + `meta` strings + `save.source_file` | **Implicit** (C4). The model *has* the discipline (epochs, merge cutoffs, registry high-water mark) but no queryable representation of it. |
| **Player empire over time** | `save.player_money_cr` per import | **Accidental and fragile.** One useful series exists because `save` accumulates between schema bumps — and is wiped by every bump (C12) on top of being polluted by reruns (C8). T0 + T5 make it real. |

Summary: identity and event history — the hard parts — are genuinely well
modeled. What's missing is (a) the *joins* that let the good parts reach
each other (entity ↔ snapshot), (b) *time depth* for anything outside the
economylog (territory, offers, station metrics), and (c) *SQL-visible
assemblies* of concepts the frames layer builds privately. The target
design is those three things.

---

## 3. Target design

Fifteen changes, T0–T14, each with DDL sketch, rationale, and migration
notes. Migration mechanics use the existing machinery — with one repair
first: W/R/D tables are drop-and-recreate on a `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump
(free, `store.py:70-74`), and E tables take targeted statements via
`EVENT_MIGRATIONS` (`schema.py:38-75`; the values are arbitrary SQL
tuples, so `UPDATE`/`CREATE INDEX` work there too) — but the migration
walk currently strands off-chain DBs and the drop-everything-else rule
catches `save`/`meta` too (C12), so **T0 must land before anything that
keys into `save` or relies on a chained E-migration**. New table classes
introduced: **A — accumulated aggregates** (append-only per snapshot,
never dropped, migrated like E tables) and **P — persistent
bookkeeping** (`save`, `meta`, `coverage`: never dropped, T0).

### T0. Make the migration machinery able to carry the design

The C12 fix, and the precondition the first draft silently assumed
(review F1/F2/X13). Two parts, no new DDL:

1. **Promote `save` and `meta` to never-dropped.** Add a
   `PERSISTENT_TABLES = ("save", "meta")` tuple in `schema.py`; the
   drop loop in `_ensure_schema` spares `EVENT_TABLES + PERSISTENT_TABLES
   + AGGREGATE_TABLES` instead of `EVENT_TABLES` alone. Rationale:
   `save` is the provenance log and the time dimension every A-table
   joins (T4), the rerun guard's evidence (T5), and the target of
   `coverage.updated_save_id` (T3) and `removed_object.first_save_id`
   (T13) — none of that can key into a table whose ids recycle on every
   bump. `meta` carries cross-run bookkeeping (`entity_registry_time`,
   `csv_caches_imported`, T13's `managed_tables`) that must not be
   dropped by the code path that reads it. Both tables' DDL is
   version-stable (append-only column adds at most), so preserving them
   costs nothing; if their shape ever must change, they migrate like E
   tables.
2. **Repair the version walk so off-chain DBs migrate.** Replace the
   `while version in EVENT_MIGRATIONS` walk (`store.py:66-69`) with a
   complete chain: every historical version gets a `NEXT_VERSION` entry
   up to the current one, with an empty migration tuple where the E/P
   tables didn't change (v4→…→v10 were all W/R/D-side bumps, so those
   entries are empty today). Future E/P migrations then reliably run for
   every DB, whatever version it sits at. Add a regression test that (a)
   a `SCHEMA_VERSION` bump preserves `save`/`meta` rows and (b) a DB
   stamped at an off-chain version (the real case: v5) walks to current
   — review backlog item 15 (re-importing the 559 h playthrough's v5 DB)
   is the live end-to-end exercise of exactly this.

*Migration:* pure code + one tuple; no data change. Independent; **T3,
T4, T5, T12, and T13 depend on it**, and §4 sequences it first.
Verified: the drop-loop and walk cites are `store.py:66-74` read
directly; the v5 DB and the 2-row `save` table are the queries under
C12; nothing else to execute until implementation (the regression test
is the implementation-time proof).

### T1. Name the current snapshot

```sql
CREATE VIEW current_save AS
SELECT MAX(save_id) AS save_id FROM save;
```

Every view and every hand-written query becomes
`WHERE save_id = (SELECT save_id FROM current_save)`. Pure ergonomics,
zero risk, and the one place to change if current-snapshot semantics ever
change (see T5).

*Migration:* add to `VIEWS`. Independent.

### T2. Entity spine: `component.entity_id`

```sql
-- component (fresh W DDL, one added column + indices)
CREATE TABLE component (
  -- ... all existing columns ...
  entity_id INTEGER            -- FK entity.entity_id (doc only), NULL when
                               -- outside the registry domain (sectors,
                               -- clusters) or unresolvable
);
CREATE INDEX idx_component_entity ON component(save_id, entity_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_component_class  ON component(save_id, class, owner);
CREATE INDEX idx_component_sector ON component(save_id, sector_macro);
```

Pipeline change: run `update_entity_registry` **before** `write_snapshot`
(or apply the returned mapping with an `UPDATE component` immediately
after — equivalent; reordering is cleaner). The registry deliberately
covers connectionless components too, so its mapping is a superset of
`component` rows — every station/ship/buildstorage row gets its
`entity_id`.

This one column makes the registry the hub it was built to be:

```sql
-- a station's full stock history, durable identity, one join
SELECT s.time, s.level
FROM component c JOIN stock_event s ON s.owner_entity = c.entity_id
WHERE c.save_id = (SELECT save_id FROM current_save)
  AND c.code = 'ABC-123' AND s.ware = 'energycells'
ORDER BY s.time;
```

Also in this change, because they're the same spine:

```sql
-- durable event-table access paths (E-table index adds, no data change)
CREATE INDEX idx_stock_entity ON stock_event(owner_entity, ware, time);
CREATE INDEX idx_tx_buyer  ON trade_tx(buyer_entity)  WHERE buyer_entity  IS NOT NULL;
CREATE INDEX idx_tx_seller ON trade_tx(seller_entity) WHERE seller_entity IS NOT NULL;
```

*Migration:* W rebuild (free) + the E-table `CREATE INDEX IF NOT
EXISTS` statements added to the `INDEXES` tuple, which `_ensure_schema`
applies idempotently at every connect (`store.py:78-79`) — **not** via
`EVENT_MIGRATIONS`, whose broken chain would skip them for off-chain DBs
(C12/review F2); routed this way, T2 does not depend on T0. Fixes C3,
C5's index half, and unblocks T4/T6/T8. **Independent; most other
changes want it.** Verified: all three component indices and the three
E-table indices (partial indexes included) created cleanly on the 8E0C
copy after `ALTER TABLE component ADD COLUMN entity_id INTEGER`
(SQLite 3.53.3).

### T3. Coverage as a table

```sql
-- P-class: bookkeeping of what the event history covers; never dropped
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS coverage (
  stream       TEXT NOT NULL,   -- 'trade_tx' | 'stock_event' | 'log:<category>'
  epoch        INTEGER NOT NULL,
  t_min        REAL NOT NULL,   -- covered interval (game seconds)
  t_max        REAL NOT NULL,
  window_start REAL,            -- most recent merged window's start
                                -- (rate denominators), newest epoch only
  updated_save_id INTEGER,      -- provenance: which import last extended it
                                -- (FK save.save_id — meaningful only once
                                -- T0 makes save never-dropped)
  PRIMARY KEY (stream, epoch)
);
```

The merge updates its stream's newest epoch row (extending `t_max`,
setting `window_start`) or inserts a new epoch row when it detects a gap
— exactly where `_merge_window` computes epochs today
(`store.py:722-748`). `log_entry` gets per-category streams, giving the
logbook the gap-awareness it currently lacks (C4).

Replaces `meta.trade_tx_window_start` / `meta.stock_event_window_start`;
`frames.py:566-571` reads the table instead. Ad-hoc SQL gains: "what does
my history cover?" is a `SELECT * FROM coverage`.

*Migration:* `CREATE TABLE` + one-time backfill inside the version bump:

```sql
INSERT INTO coverage (stream, epoch, t_min, t_max)
  SELECT 'trade_tx', epoch, MIN(time), MAX(time) FROM trade_tx GROUP BY epoch;
INSERT INTO coverage (stream, epoch, t_min, t_max)
  SELECT 'stock_event', epoch, MIN(time), MAX(time) FROM stock_event GROUP BY epoch;
INSERT INTO coverage (stream, epoch, t_min, t_max)
  SELECT 'log:' || COALESCE(category, ''), 0, MIN(time), MAX(time)
  FROM log_entry GROUP BY category;
```

then seed `window_start` from the two meta keys and delete them. No
history loss. **Depends on T0** twice over: the backfill is an
E/P-migration and must ride the repaired chain to reach off-chain DBs
(C12/review F2), and `updated_save_id` is only worth writing once `save`
survives bumps (review F1). Better with T5's rerun guard. Verified: the
table DDL and all three backfill INSERTs executed on the 8E0C copy —
resulting coverage `trade_tx[961–71,852]`, `stock_event[83–71,875]`
plus per-category `log:*` rows.

### T4. Aggregate history: the trend layer (A-class tables)

The C1 fix. Not snapshot retention — small append-only aggregates written
once per *distinct* snapshot (guard from T5), sized so a dense autosave
stream is cheap. All rows carry `save_id`; joining `save.game_time` gives
the time axis — which is exactly why this whole item **requires T0**:
without it, the first schema bump resets `save` and every accrued
`save_id` silently points at the wrong (or no) import row (review F1).

Key-column rule (review F6): SQLite treats a `NULL` in a non-INTEGER
PRIMARY KEY column as distinct-from-everything, so a nullable PK column
makes the key decorative — duplicate appends succeed. `sector_macro`
and `owner` ARE null in practice (objects in transit / ownerless), so
every textual key column below is `NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` and the
`INSERT … SELECT` wraps them in `COALESCE(x, '')`. Uniqueness then holds
in the table itself, not just in the T5 guard (which F1 showed can be
defeated post-bump).

```sql
-- territory & military presence: ~1,500 rows / snapshot (measured shape:
-- the spike's 9.5 ms heatmap query), ≈60 KB per snapshot
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sector_presence (
  save_id      INTEGER NOT NULL,
  sector_macro TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',  -- '' = no sector (in transit)
  owner        TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',  -- '' = ownerless
  class        TEXT NOT NULL,       -- station | ship_xl | ship_l | ...
  n            INTEGER NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (save_id, sector_macro, owner, class)
);

-- per-player-station economics: one row per station per snapshot
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS station_metric (
  save_id       INTEGER NOT NULL,
  entity_id     INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- durable station identity (T2)
  workforce     REAL,               -- Σ workforce.amount
  modules_built INTEGER,            -- COUNT(module WHERE built=1)
  cargo_value_cr REAL,              -- Σ cargo.amount × ware.price_avg
  buy_open_cr   REAL,               -- Σ open buy offers × price
  sell_open_cr  REAL,               -- Σ open sell offers × price
  PRIMARY KEY (save_id, entity_id)
);

-- market history, sector granularity: per (sector, ware, side) price
-- band + open volume. ~63 wares × active sectors × 2 ≈ 3–6 k rows
-- per snapshot. THE only obtainable NPC price signal over time —
-- the save's economylog carries no NPC↔NPC transactions
-- (savegame-structure.md § economylog), but the offer book is complete
-- every snapshot.
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS market_stat (
  save_id      INTEGER NOT NULL,
  sector_macro TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',  -- '' = offer host has no sector
  ware         TEXT NOT NULL,
  side         TEXT NOT NULL,       -- buy | sell
  n_offers     INTEGER NOT NULL,
  units        REAL,                -- Σ amount
  price_min_cr REAL, price_avg_cr REAL, price_max_cr REAL,
  PRIMARY KEY (save_id, sector_macro, ware, side)
);
```

(`station_metric` needs no sentinel: both its key columns are already
`NOT NULL`, and `entity_id` comes from the registry, which never mints
NULL.)

All three are `INSERT … SELECT` from tables `write_snapshot` just wrote —
no parser change, no new data source, single-digit milliseconds each.
Deliberately *not* proposed: per-station offer history (15 k rows ×
every autosave adds up; the sector band answers the analytical questions
— "where is energy-cell price heading" — and per-station current offers
are always in `trade_offer`). If a per-station price series is ever
wanted, add it as a change-only variant later; the A-class mechanics will
already exist.

*Migration:* three `CREATE TABLE`s, start empty — history accrues from
the next run. Nothing to lose. **Depends on T0** (never-dropped `save`,
without which the time axis breaks on the first bump), **T2** (entity_id
for `station_metric`) **and T5** (rerun guard so dev reruns don't append
duplicate rows). Migrated like E tables (never dropped) — add an
`AGGREGATE_TABLES` tuple beside `EVENT_TABLES` in `schema.py`; T0's
drop-loop change spares it. Verified on the 8E0C copy: all three tables
created; the prescribed `INSERT … SELECT` populates produced 1,703
`sector_presence` rows and 4,529 `market_stat` rows (inside the 3–6 k
predicted band) in well under a second; re-running the same
`sector_presence` append fails with `UNIQUE constraint failed` — the
review's F6 duplicate-insert reproduction succeeds against the *old*
nullable DDL and is rejected by this one.

> **Shipped (2026-07-24, Phase 4, schema v13** — the roadmap penciled
> this phase in as v12 before T15 took that number**).** Two deviations

### T5. Separate "import run" from "snapshot"

Keep `save` append-only (it is the provenance log and the A-tables' time
dimension) but make distinctness queryable and re-runs harmless:

```sql
-- distinct snapshots: first import row of each distinct save
CREATE VIEW v_snapshot AS
SELECT MIN(save_id) AS save_id, guid, game_time, save_date,
       player_money_cr, player_name
FROM save
GROUP BY guid, game_time, save_date;
```

Store-side rule (one EXISTS check in `write_snapshot`): an import whose
(`game_time`, `save_date`) already exists is a **rerun** — W tables still
rebuild (that's the point of a rerun), but A-table appends are skipped.
The player-money series and every T4 series then read from `v_snapshot`
density, immune to dashboard-dev reruns (C8).

*Migration:* view + store guard; no data change. **Depends on T0**: the
EXISTS check reads `save`, and a schema bump that empties `save` (review
F1) would make every prior snapshot look new — the guard would happily
re-append A-rows it can no longer see. T4 wants this item. Verified:
`v_snapshot` executed on the 8E0C copy — 2 `save` rows collapse to 1
distinct snapshot, matching the known state (two imports of one save).

> **Shipped (2026-07-24, Phase 4).** The store-side rule generalized:
> instead of "rerun ⇒ skip A-appends", A rows key on the **canonical
> snapshot id** (`v_snapshot`'s MIN(save_id), `store.snapshot_id()`) and
> `write_aggregates` appends a table's rows only when that snapshot has
> none there yet. Same rerun-immunity, plus: a snapshot first imported
> *before* the A layer existed (or via a historic `seed-trends` import)
> still receives its rows on its next import — the spec's plain skip
> would have left such snapshots without trend rows forever.

### T6. Event-history views: the domain read layer

Replaces the pandas re-derivations of C6 with connect-created views.

```sql
-- trades in domain terms: commander-redirected ("Executed by" rule),
-- current display names via the registry, ware names resolved.
-- Executor DISPLAY columns (exec_name/exec_code) survive because
-- viz/history.py renders them ({side}.proxy.name/.code, history.py:59-66)
-- and entity ids alone cannot recover them for NULL-entity rows
-- (review F3). The proxied flag keys on cmdr_id, not cmdr_entity —
-- frames' rule is cmdr_id.notna() (frames.py), and the csv-import path
-- writes cmdr ids with NULL entities (store.py:867), so an entity-keyed
-- flag would silently diverge on those rows.
CREATE VIEW v_trade AS
SELECT t.time, t.ware, COALESCE(w.name, t.ware) AS ware_name,
       t.price_cr, t.amount, t.price_cr * t.amount AS total_cr,
       t.epoch,
       COALESCE(t.buyer_cmdr_entity,  t.buyer_entity)  AS buyer_entity,
       COALESCE(t.seller_cmdr_entity, t.seller_entity) AS seller_entity,
       t.buyer_faction, t.seller_faction,
       COALESCE(be.name, t.buyer_cmdr_name,  t.buyer_name)  AS buyer_name,
       COALESCE(se.name, t.seller_cmdr_name, t.seller_name) AS seller_name,
       COALESCE(t.buyer_cmdr_code,  t.buyer_code)  AS buyer_code,
       COALESCE(t.seller_cmdr_code, t.seller_code) AS seller_code,
       t.buyer_entity  AS buyer_exec_entity,   -- the executing ship when
       t.seller_entity AS seller_exec_entity,  -- a subordinate traded
       CASE WHEN t.buyer_cmdr_id IS NOT NULL THEN t.buyer_name END
         AS buyer_exec_name,                   -- executor display identity,
       CASE WHEN t.buyer_cmdr_id IS NOT NULL THEN t.buyer_code END
         AS buyer_exec_code,                   -- present only when proxied
       CASE WHEN t.seller_cmdr_id IS NOT NULL THEN t.seller_name END
         AS seller_exec_name,
       CASE WHEN t.seller_cmdr_id IS NOT NULL THEN t.seller_code END
         AS seller_exec_code,
       t.buyer_cmdr_id IS NOT NULL  AS buyer_proxied,
       t.seller_cmdr_id IS NOT NULL AS seller_proxied
FROM trade_tx t
LEFT JOIN ware w    ON w.id = t.ware
LEFT JOIN entity be ON be.entity_id = COALESCE(t.buyer_cmdr_entity,  t.buyer_entity)
LEFT JOIN entity se ON se.entity_id = COALESCE(t.seller_cmdr_entity, t.seller_entity);
```

This keeps the frames-layer subtlety that matters (rename-proof current
names via the registry; the proxy-attribution toggle stays possible
because executor columns survive) and drops the one that doesn't: the
latest-name-per-code pandas fallback (`frames.py:464-473`) degrades to
the stored merge-time name. (The first draft called the affected rows "a
shrinking set" — wrong, per review F4: NULL-entity parties are minted at
*every* merge, for removed-object-resolved and registry-missed parties;
verified on the 8E0C copy, `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trade_tx WHERE
raw_attrs IS NOT NULL AND (buyer_entity IS NULL OR seller_entity IS
NULL)` → 2 rows merged under the current schema. The degradation is
still acceptable — those parties have no registry identity to resolve
against, so the stored name is the best available either way — but it is
permanent, not transitional.) `frames.tradelog` becomes a thin
`read_sql` + Categorical dressing.

```sql
-- stock flows partitioned by durable identity (renames v_stock_delta;
-- keep the old name as an alias view for one release)
CREATE VIEW v_stock_flow AS
SELECT owner_entity, owner_id, owner_faction, owner_code, owner_name,
       ware, time, level, epoch,
       MAX(level - LAG(level) OVER w, 0) AS inflow,
       MAX(LAG(level) OVER w - level, 0) AS outflow
FROM stock_event
WHERE ware != ''
WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY COALESCE('e' || owner_entity,
                                   owner_faction || '|' || owner_code,
                                   owner_id),
             ware, epoch ORDER BY time, rowid);
```

> **Note (2026-07-24, R3/T15):** the `ware != ''` guard existed solely to
> exclude the money-block rows the old ingestion shunted into
> `stock_event`; T15's v12 migration re-typed those rows into

> code under the v12 schema.

Entity-first partitioning (C5) with the existing text fallbacks for
pre-registry rows; with T2's `idx_stock_entity` the per-station query
drops from a scan to an index range.

```sql
-- entity biographies: lifespan + a uniform event stream
CREATE VIEW v_entity_life AS
SELECT e.*,
       COALESCE(e.gone_time,
                (SELECT game_time FROM save
                 WHERE save_id = (SELECT save_id FROM current_save)))
         - e.first_seen                        AS observed_span_s,
       e.gone_time IS NULL                     AS alive,
       c.id                                    AS component_id,   -- NULL if not in current snapshot
       c.sector_macro
FROM entity e
LEFT JOIN component c ON c.entity_id = e.entity_id
  AND c.save_id = (SELECT save_id FROM current_save);
```

*Migration:* views only (recreated at connect / on version bump per T10).
`v_stock_delta` survives one release as `CREATE VIEW v_stock_delta AS
SELECT *, inflow AS dv, outflow AS dv_neg FROM v_stock_flow` then goes.
**Depends on T2** for its performance half and for `v_entity_life`'s
`component.entity_id` join (which does not exist until T2 lands); the
other views work today. Which frames responsibilities move: `tradelog`
assembly, `global_trades` identity enrichment (the removed-object dagger
logic folds into `v_entity_life.alive`), stock-delta access. Verified on
the 8E0C copy (with T2's column shimmed in via `ALTER TABLE component
ADD COLUMN entity_id`): all three views execute; `v_trade` returns
exactly `trade_tx`'s 3,133 rows; its proxied flags match frames' rule
row-for-row (261 buyer / 2,038 seller proxied — identical to `COUNT(*)
… WHERE {side}_cmdr_id IS NOT NULL`); `{side}_exec_name`/`_exec_code`
are non-NULL for all 2,038 proxied seller rows; `v_entity_life` returns
35,456 entities, 18,289 alive.

> **Shipped (2026-07-24, Phase 5 / M2).** Three deviations from the DDL
> sketches above, all toward exact frames parity:
> 1. `v_trade` redirects with `CASE WHEN {side}_cmdr_id IS NOT NULL`
>    instead of `COALESCE` on the entity columns — a proxied row whose

>    executor's identity (same rule as the proxied flags, review F3).
> 2. `v_trade` additionally exposes redirected `{side}_id` and
>    `{side}_exec_id` columns (the per-object views consume ids), and
>    `_exec_name` is registry-resolved like the main names (frames
>    re-resolved the executor column too).
> 3. `v_stock_flow` ships **without** the `ware != ''` guard, per the

### T7. Diplomacy view

[2026-07-31: superseded — effective standing is the booster when present,
replacing the base; E-145, faction-relations-model.md. The additive law
described in the SQL and prose below was falsified (E-083); the shipped
`v_faction_standing` (db-schema.md) already uses the replace rule.]

```sql
CREATE VIEW v_faction_standing AS
SELECT faction, other,
       SUM(CASE WHEN kind = 'base'    THEN value ELSE 0 END) AS base,
       SUM(CASE WHEN kind = 'booster' THEN value ELSE 0 END) AS booster,
       MIN(1.0, MAX(-1.0, SUM(value))) AS effective
FROM faction_relation
WHERE save_id = (SELECT save_id FROM current_save)
  AND kind IN ('base', 'booster')   -- frames keys on base ∪ booster only:
                                    -- a discount-only pair must emit no row
GROUP BY faction, other;
```

Reproduces the `frames.py:624-651` pivot: effective = clamp(base +
Σboosters, [−1, 1]). The first draft called this "verbatim" while
emitting rows for discount-only pairs that frames excludes (review F11)
— the `kind` filter in the WHERE fixes that (and lets the effective SUM
drop its CASE). The first draft also justified SUM-without-decay with
"boosters are stored pre-decayed" — that claim is **unconfirmed**
(review X3 / faction-model F1: zero decay observed across 4 saves, and
every decaying `set_relation_boost` call site is object-level, not
faction-pair). The view does not depend on it: it reproduces frames'
arithmetic, which matches the save's stored values whether those are
pre-decayed, never-decaying, or decayed-at-load. If review backlog
item 9 ("booster decay: observe or kill") ever finds live decay, the fix
is a view change here, not a schema change. Discounts stay a plain
filter on `faction_relation`. *Migration:* view only. Independent.
Verified on the 8E0C copy: view executes; 992 (faction, other) pairs —
exactly the `SELECT DISTINCT` count of base∪booster pairs frames would
key on; discount-only pairs in this save: 0 (the filter is still
load-bearing for saves that have them).

### T8. Station and fleet assemblies

```sql
-- one row per station, the concept "station" assembled
CREATE VIEW v_station AS
SELECT c.id, c.entity_id, c.name, c.basename, c.code, c.owner,
       c.sector_macro, sec.name AS sector_name, c.sx, c.sz, c.knownto,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM module m
         WHERE m.save_id = c.save_id AND m.host_id = c.id AND m.built = 1)
         AS modules_built,
       (SELECT SUM(w.amount) FROM workforce w
         WHERE w.save_id = c.save_id AND w.station_id = c.id) AS workforce,
       (SELECT SUM(cg.amount * COALESCE(wr.volume, 0)) FROM cargo cg
         LEFT JOIN ware wr ON wr.id = cg.ware
         WHERE cg.save_id = c.save_id AND cg.object_id = c.id)
         AS cargo_volume_m3
FROM component c
LEFT JOIN sector_ref sec ON sec.macro = c.sector_macro
WHERE c.class = 'station'
  AND c.save_id = (SELECT save_id FROM current_save);
```

Correlated subqueries are fine at ~1,200 stations (all index-served after
T2's `idx_module_host` companions). The pandas rollups in
`frames.py:336-366` shrink to reading this plus the posts pivot; the
hull/mass estimate (`modules × 250_000`) can join on `modules_built` or
stay in pandas — it is a display heuristic, not data.

```sql
-- player fleet edges, entity-keyed (replaces _player_edges' second
-- resolution, C7): resolved once in write_snapshot, filtered here
CREATE VIEW v_player_fleet AS
SELECT fe.follower_id, cf.entity_id AS follower_entity,
       fe.commander_id, cc.entity_id AS commander_entity
FROM fleet_edge fe
JOIN component cf ON cf.id = fe.follower_id  AND cf.save_id = fe.save_id
JOIN component cc ON cc.id = fe.commander_id AND cc.save_id = fe.save_id
WHERE cf.owner = 'player' AND cc.owner = 'player'
  AND fe.save_id = (SELECT save_id FROM current_save);
```

`merge_events` then takes its commander map from this view's underlying
query instead of re-deriving from raw save lists, and `frames.wings`
becomes a `read_sql`. One equivalence assumption, stated explicitly
(review F10): `_player_edges` resolves owners over **all** parsed
components (`store.py:599`), while this view JOINs `component`, which
excludes connectionless components (`store.py:207`, the `if connection`
filter) — the two differ iff a fleet edge touches a connectionless
player object. The review measured 0 divergent rows today; the
implementation must either keep that invariant checked (a test comparing
the view to `_player_edges` output on a real save before deleting the
latter) or resolve edges in `write_snapshot` before the filter applies.
*Migration:* views + deleting `_player_edges`. Depends on T2. Verified
on the 8E0C copy (T2 column shimmed): both views execute; `v_station`
1,771 rows, `v_player_fleet` 110 rows.

> **Shipped (2026-07-24, Phase 5 / M3).** The equivalence route was
> taken (not the pre-filter resolve): `_player_edges(save)` compared to

> (per-race `workforce.*`, max-index `modules`/`hull`/`mass`) retired
> with the pandas block.

### T9. Load `region_yield` reference; resource status becomes SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS region_yield (
  level       TEXT NOT NULL,         -- verylow … veryhigh
  ware        TEXT NOT NULL,
  capacity    REAL,                  -- full-area yield
  respawn_min REAL,                  -- MINUTES (source unit); -1 = never
  PRIMARY KEY (level, ware)
);

CREATE VIEW v_resource_area AS
SELECT r.sector_macro, r.ware, r.yield, r.level, r.speed, r.starttime,
       ry.capacity, ry.respawn_min,
       CASE WHEN r.yield > 0 THEN 'live'
            WHEN ry.capacity IS NULL OR ry.capacity = 0 THEN 'unknown'
            WHEN ry.respawn_min < 0 THEN 'never'
            WHEN r.starttime <= (SELECT game_time FROM save
                                 WHERE save_id = (SELECT save_id FROM current_save))
                 THEN 'full'
            ELSE 'respawning' END AS status
FROM resource r
LEFT JOIN region_yield ry ON ry.level = r.level AND ry.ware = r.ware
WHERE r.save_id = (SELECT save_id FROM current_save);
```

The delay column is named for its actual unit (review X21): the source
column `regionyields.csv:respawndelay` is **minutes** (`verylow,ore` =
20; frames uses it as minutes throughout — `rate = cap/delay*60` per
hour, `frames.py:241`; the depletion model's timer algebra is `starttime
= depletion + respawndelay×60` seconds). The first draft's `respawn_s`
would have loaded minute values under a seconds name, handing any SQL
ETA arithmetic against `starttime` (seconds) a silent 60× bug. Keeping
minutes (rather than converting ×60 at load) matches the CSV, the XSD,
and frames — anyone joining against `starttime` must convert, and the
name now says so.

Status-model caveats inherited from the review's re-testing of the
depletion model (X21's second half — the first draft froze the model
pre-correction):

- `'full'` reports the *reference capacity* as available — **settled
  correct, nividium included** (backlog item 11, confirmed 2026-07-24:
  the Pious Mists XI protocol is exactly B11's test and pinned
  materialize-to-full; the review's 4.4%-of-cap nividium tail
  (resource-model F5) was post-materialization drawdown between saves,
  not partial materialization).
- *Depletion* relocates the area ~95 % of the time (resource-model F1;
  B5 settled it 2026-07-24: 123 moves vs 6 in-place depletions, per-axis
  20 km-lattice steps, position breaks at every full depletion), so
  nothing keyed on per-area position may be layered on this view; at
  the (sector, ware) granularity the view actually exposes, relocation
  is immaterial (areas move within their sector — confirmed for all 123
  observed moves). The model rewrite this bullet used to track landed in
  resource-depletion-model.md (B5).

Encodes the timer/eligibility layer of the respawn model that *did*
survive review (starttime = depletion + delay, arm-at-zero, eligibility
gating — confirmed 149/151 events; the `starttime = 0` case folds into
`<=` since game_time > 0 always) so "what can I mine right now, where"
is a query. Frames keeps only the wide sector pivot for the map.
*Migration:* one more R-table load in `write_reference` from the already-
packaged `regionyields.csv` + view. Independent. Verified on the 8E0C
copy: table + view execute; with the packaged CSV loaded, the view's
status matches a verbatim reimplementation of `frames._classify`
(`frames.py:228-240`) on **all 3,246 areas, 0 mismatches** (3,059 live /
146 full / 41 respawning in this save).

### T10. Live-mode operations

- **WAL**: `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` once at `open_db` (persistent in the
  file), plus `PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000` and `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL`
  on every connection. Writer (analyzer/watch) and readers (serve) stop
  blocking each other. One-line change; WAL sidecar files are the only
  visible effect.
- **View lifecycle**: stop recreating views at every connect (C9).
  Store `views_version` in `meta`; recreate views only when it differs
  from the code's (bumping it is free — views are cheap DDL). Read-only
  connections then always see current views and the serve TEMP-view
  duplication dies.
- **Reference-write churn** (C14/review F9): `write_reference` rewrites
  all nine R tables + the full textdb on every run (`store.py:157-167`).
  Under a watcher this is pointless write load on data that changes only
  when `extract-gamedata` reruns. Fix: store a digest of the reference
  CSVs (or their mtimes) in `meta('reference_digest')` and skip
  `write_reference` when unchanged. One guard, same shape as the
  `csv_caches_imported` flag.
- **Analyzer split** (parse→DB vs DB→render) is the spike's P7 and out of
  scope here, but note the schema is already split-ready: everything the
  render phase needs is in the DB except four `SaveData` scalars, which
  the spike's shim recovered — with T4/T5 in place, `has_highways` and
  `player_faction_name` belong as `save` columns (two W-side column adds)
  to close that gap.

*Migration:* pragmas + meta keys; no table changes. Independent (the
digest guard's meta key only survives bumps under T0, but losing it
merely causes one redundant reference write — acceptable without T0).
High leverage for goal 1.

### T11. Naming and convention cleanups (W/R rebuild = free renames)

All in one version bump; compatibility views keep old names alive for one
release where consumers exist:

| Change | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `module` → `build_entry` (+ compat view `module`) | it holds plan entries; the misnomer caused the 2× capacity bug class (C10). `v_built_module` keeps its name — its meaning was always right |
| `modcap` → `module_cap` | pairs with `module_ref` |
| `faction_meta.account` → `account_cr` (÷100 at load) | kills the one raw-cents exception |
| `trade_offer.object_id`: drop NOT NULL, `''` → NULL | kills the one empty-string exception; hostless offers become `object_id IS NULL`, consistent with every other column |
| `npc` → keep name, document; or `player_npc` if renamed anyway | lowest priority of the set |

Not proposed: renaming `*_ref` reference tables to bare names or vice
versa wholesale — churn without a defect; new reference tables should
follow `*_ref` (T9's `region_yield` deliberately has no `_ref` because it
is keyed by (level, ware), not a game id — judgment call, either is
defensible). E-table conventions (`trade_tx.ware = ''`) stay: changing
them is an UPDATE over irreplaceable history for zero analytical gain.

*Migration:* free for W tables (drop/recreate); compat views cost
nothing. Independent.

### T12. `log_entry.interact` fix + backfill

Loader reads the correct attribute going forward; one E-migration
statement recovers the past from `raw_attrs`:

```sql
UPDATE log_entry
SET interaction = json_extract(raw_attrs, '$.interact')
WHERE interaction IS NULL AND raw_attrs IS NOT NULL;
```

(`json_extract` is built into the sqlite3 Python ships.) Optionally
rename the column to `interact` to match the save; the backfill is the
part that matters. *Migration:* `EVENT_MIGRATIONS` entry — which means
**depends on T0**: without the repaired chain the entry never runs for
off-chain DBs like the real v5 one (C12/review F2).

### T13. Migration-machinery hygiene

- **Zombie tables** (C11): write the managed-table inventory to
  `meta('managed_tables', json array)` at every schema write; on a
  version bump, drop tables that are in the stored inventory but absent
  from the current code's list (never touching E/A/P tables or unknown
  user tables). Retroactively drops `station_drones` on the next bump.
  Requires T0: pre-T0, the bump path drops `meta` itself before the
  inventory could be consulted (review F1).
- **`removed_object.first_save_id`**: `ALTER TABLE removed_object ADD
  COLUMN first_save_id INTEGER` — stamp at merge so graveyard rows carry
  arrival provenance (their only obtainable timestamp; the save-side
  `time` attr does not exist in v9, so the existing always-NULL `time`
  column can be dropped from the fresh DDL while the ALTER path leaves it
  in old DBs — harmless either way). Requires T0 twice: the ALTER is an
  `EVENT_MIGRATIONS` entry (needs the repaired chain to reach the v5
  DB), and the stamped ids are provenance only if `save` stops being
  reset (review F1/F2).

*Migration:* meta bookkeeping + one E-table ALTER. **Depends on T0.**

### T14. Stale-save merge guard: make "no history loss" actually true

The C13 fix (review F8) — the one defect class where the *current*
model destroys irreplaceable history, and the highest-stakes one for
goal 1, since a live-mode watcher is exactly the component that will
eventually feed saves out of order. Design: mirror the entity registry's
high-water guard (`store.py:412-417`) at the top of `merge_events` —
compare the incoming `save.game_time` against the stored high-water mark
(per-stream `MAX(time)`, or T3's `coverage.t_max` once it exists) and
**skip the merge with a warning** when the save is older, exactly as
`update_entity_registry` already does for lifecycle edits. Skipping is
deliberately conservative: an older save's window *could* in principle
back-fill history older than everything stored (insert-only, no
delete), but distinguishing safe back-fill from destructive overlap
inside `_merge_window`'s boundary logic is subtle, and the guard's job
is to make the destructive path (`DELETE FROM {table} WHERE time >=
mintime`, `store.py:736`) unreachable first. A back-fill mode can be a
later refinement if it ever matters.

*Migration:* code only, no DDL. Independent (T3's coverage table makes
the check cheaper but `MAX(time)` works today). Review backlog item 3 is
the empirical proof-of-destruction on a scratch copy — worth running
once before implementation to pin the failure in a test. Verified: the
unconditional delete is `store.py:736` read directly; the registry
guard pattern being mirrored is `store.py:412-417`.

### T15. Economylog ingestion by ledger: type the four blocks, re-type the mis-merged rows

The backlog item 1 (B1) fix, anticipated by roadmap refinement R2. The
economylog is four typed ledgers keyed by the *wrapper*
(`<entries type="cargo|tradeoffer|trade|money">`); the `<log type=…>`
attribute names the *mutation cause*, not the record type. The parser
collects every `<log type="trade">` regardless of block, so
`_merge_trades` ingests three different record types under one
heuristic — and the money-block family (player money ledger, `v` in
cents) lands in `stock_event` as fake `ware=''` stock snapshots, the
sole reason for `v_stock_delta`'s `ware != ''` guard.

B1 verdicts this design consumes (evidence:
docs/reports/phase3-event-semantics.md): money-block rows are the
**player's** per-object money ledger (every resolvable owner is
player-faction across both playthroughs); their `tradeentry` attr is a
1-based ordinal into the trade block (1,295/1,295 and 6,762/6,764
pair-matched); `v` is cents (price×amount exact or <0.01% for the
unamended majority); cargo-block v-less `type="trade"` rows mean stock
0 (2,591/2,591 against same-save `<cargo>`) — the store's existing
assumption, now confirmed. B18 rides along: trade-block
`type="transfer"` rows are player-internal ware movements, the missing
slice of the save's own `trades_executed` counter.

Design:

- **Parser** tracks the enclosing `<entries type>` (one variable on the
  existing stacks; the depth-1 block only — stations embed self-closing
  `<economylog>` stubs) and splits collection: `trades` = trade-block
  rows (all types), `stock_logs` = cargo-block `type="trade"` rows,
  `money_logs` = money-block rows (all types). Volume is unchanged
  (~400 k dicts); the tradeoffer block stays uncollected.
- **`_merge_trades`** types by origin, not attribute shape: trade-block
  rows → `trade_tx` (new `kind` column = the type attr, `'trade'` /
  `'transfer'`; `price_cr` now nullable — transfers and the 3 price-less
  trades ingest instead of vanishing), cargo-block rows → `stock_event`
  (absent `v` still 0, now evidence-backed), money-block rows → new E
  table **`money_event`** (owner/partner identity resolved at merge time
  like the other E tables; `kind` = the type attr; `tradeentry`;
  `value_cr` = amended `v2` else `v`, ÷100; rolling-window merge +
  coverage stream like its siblings).
- **`v_stock_delta`** drops the `ware != ''` guard — after the
  migration below no ware-less row can exist in `stock_event` (the csv
  legacy import never wrote stock rows, verified).
- **Migration (v12, `EVENT_MIGRATIONS["11"]`)**: create `money_event`;
  `trade_tx` gains `kind` (existing rows backfilled `'trade'` — the old
  ingestion criterion guaranteed it); move every `stock_event` row with
  `ware = ''` into `money_event`, extracting partner/kind/tradeentry/v
  from `raw_attrs` JSON, keeping epoch and owner columns; delete the
  moved rows. Stays in the chain indefinitely so any older DB is
  corrected on open.
- **frames.tradelog** filters `kind = 'trade' AND price_cr IS NOT NULL`
  — DB completeness changes, dashboard behavior doesn't (transfers and
  price-less rows are stored, not yet displayed).

*Migration:* v12 bump as above; rides the repaired chain (T0), so v5/v10
DBs pick it up on open. **Depends on** nothing in this plan; T6's M2
must restate or drop its `v_stock_flow` guard when it lands (R3 — see
the T6 note). Verified: B1/B18 sweeps on save_003, save_010 and the
559 h playthrough's newest save; migration rehearsed on scratch copies
of both real DBs before the real run (phase 3 report).

## 4. Prioritized recommendations

Impact is against the two goals (live mode, ad-hoc SQL). "Independent"
means implementable and shippable alone. This table is the *plan's*
ordering; the review's P1/P2/P3 research backlog
([data-model-review.md](data-model-review.md)) is a separate list —
cross-references below name backlog items where one gates or exercises
the other, but the lists stay distinct: T-items change the schema,
backlog items settle evidence.

| # | Change | Impact | Depends on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **H0** | T0 migration machinery (never-dropped `save`/`meta`, repaired version chain) | **High** (precondition) | — | Do first: H3, H4's coverage variant, M1, M4, L2, L3 all key into it. Review backlog item 15 (re-import the v5 DB) is its live test |
| **H1** | T2 entity spine (`component.entity_id` + E-indices + pipeline reorder) | **High** | — | The keystone. Unblocks H3, M2, M3. E-indices ride the idempotent `INDEXES` path, not the chain |
| **H2** | T10 WAL + view-lifecycle fix + reference-write digest guard | **High** (live mode) | — | Smallest diff of any high item |
| **H3** | T4 aggregate history (`sector_presence`, `station_metric`, `market_stat`) | **High** | H0, H1, M1 | The trend layer; value compounds with every analyzed save — start as soon as H0/H1 land |
| **H4** | T14 stale-save merge guard | **High** (live mode; protects irreplaceable history) | — | Run review backlog item 3 (proof-of-destruction) first to pin the failure in a test |
| **M1** | T5 snapshot-vs-rerun (`v_snapshot` + A-write guard) | Medium | H0 | Trivial alone; H3 needs it; guard is blind without H0 |
| **M2** | T6 event views (`v_trade`, `v_stock_flow`, `v_entity_life`) | Medium-high | H1 (perf + `v_entity_life`'s join; other views correct without) | Moves the biggest pandas blocks into SQL |
| **M3** | T8 assemblies (`v_station`, `v_player_fleet`) + de-duplicate fleet resolution | Medium | H1 | Kills C6-rollups and C7; verify the `_player_edges` equivalence invariant before deleting it |
| **M4** | T3 coverage table | Medium | H0 | Provenance made queryable; backfill preserves everything; needs the repaired chain to reach off-chain DBs |
| **M5** | T9 `region_yield` + `v_resource_area` | Medium | — | Closes the one reference gap forcing pandas; units corrected (minutes); track review backlog items 5/11 for the model caveats |
| **M6** | T1 `current_save` + T7 `v_faction_standing` | Medium (ergonomics) | — | Views only; can ride along with any bump; T7 no longer presumes booster-decay semantics (review backlog item 9) |
| **H5** | T15 economylog ingestion by ledger (+ `money_event`, `trade_tx.kind`) | **High** (stops mis-typed rows accumulating every import) | — | B1/B18 evidence consumed; shipped as the v12 bump (phase 3) |
| **L1** | T11 naming cleanups | Low | — | Batch into whichever bump comes first |
| **L2** | T12 `interact` backfill | Low | H0 | One migration statement — on the repaired chain |
| **L3** | T13 zombie-drop hygiene + `removed_object.first_save_id` | Low | H0 | Migration-machinery debt |

Suggested sequencing: **H0 + H1 + H2 + H4** in one schema bump (v11 —
H0 and H4 are code-only and protect everything after), **M1 + H3** next
(v12, starts accruing history — the sooner the better), then M2–M6 as
view-mostly increments, L* batched opportunistically. Every step keeps
the DB consumable by the current frames.py; frames functions retire one
at a time as their view replacements land.

History-loss statement, explicitly: no proposal drops or rewrites rows in
`trade_tx`, `stock_event`, `log_entry`, `removed_object`, `entity`, or
`entity_event`. The only discarded artifacts are derivable-and-rebuilt
(W/R/D tables during version bumps — the designed path), the two
`meta` window keys (superseded by a backfilled `coverage`), and the
`v_stock_delta` view name (aliased for one release). One correction the
review forced on this statement (F8): the *current* model can lose
history — a stale-save merge deletes newer E rows unconditionally — so
"no change loses history" is only honest once T14's guard lands; until
then the statement describes the proposals, not the status quo.
