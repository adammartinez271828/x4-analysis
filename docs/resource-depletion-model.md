# How X4 resource depletion & respawn works (current understanding)

Reference for the resource-extraction feature work. Assembled 2026-07-21
from the game files (`libraries/regionyields.xml` + its `.xsd`), an
empirical study of 13 saves, and a **live in-game experiment** (Pious Mists XI,
below) that settled the respawn trigger. Each claim is tagged by confidence:

- **[DOC]** — stated in the game's own XSD documentation (authoritative).
- **[OBS]** — directly observed in save data (with the evidence).
- **[EXP]** — established by a controlled in-game experiment.
- **[INF]** — inferred/consistent-with, but not independently verified.

## The mechanic in one paragraph

A resource area holds a pool of one ware up to a fixed capacity. Mining
draws that pool down. **Partial areas do not refill** — there is no gradual
regeneration. When an area is fully **depleted**, it **respawns full**
`respawndelay` **minutes** later — the ore is genuinely back and mineable at
that point (the encyclopedia renders it at capacity). The subtlety is purely
in the **stored representation**: the save's `yield` field lazily keeps
reading **0** until a miner **actually mines the area**, at which point the
stored value materializes to reflect the ore that was already there and the
miner extracts from it. So a respawned-but-untouched area **is** full — the
field value just doesn't show it until touched. A sector's "replenishment" is
thus a series of discrete, whole-area respawns whose *stored* values catch up
on a miner's mining contact. No mining → no depletion, so the area never
enters this cycle at all.

## Source data

### Game files — `libraries/regionyields.xml`

Defines the templates every resource area references:

- **Yield levels** `verylow · low · medium · high · veryhigh`, each giving a
  per-ware `yield` (the area's capacity) and a `respawndelay`. For ore:
  5,000 / 50,000 / 200,000 / 1,000,000 / 2,000,000 with respawndelay
  20 / 40 / 60 / 120 / 180. **[DOC]**
- **Gatherspeeds** `veryslow · slow · average · fast · veryfast` with
  `factor` 0.2 / 0.5 / 1.0 / 2.0 / 5.0 and a `rating` 3 / 6 / 9 / 12 / 15.
  **[DOC]**

The XSD documents the two key attributes verbatim:

- `yield`: *"The total amount of yield in this area"* — i.e. the capacity. **[DOC]**
- `respawndelay` (`xs:float`): *"The time after it was depleted **(in
  minutes)** before this resource area is respawned **at a random
  location**. Defaults to 0. Set to -1 to prevent respawning."* **[DOC]**

`region_definitions.xml` carries a 9.00 note: resource areas are now defined
per-**sector** in `mapdefaults.xml` under `<properties><resourceareas>`,
referencing `regionyields.xml`. **[DOC]**

**Caveat — "at a random location" is not what we observe.** Across every
tracked case an `<area>` keeps its `<offset><position>` through depletion
*and* respawn: it materializes full at its own fixed spot, it does not move
(see the trackability note below). The XSD's "random location" most plausibly
refers to where the physical asteroid rocks spawn *within* the area's boundary
sphere, not the area record relocating — but at the `<area>` level respawn is
**in place**. **[OBS overrides the literal DOC wording here.]**

### Save files — the `<resourceareas>` block

At runtime the areas live in a flat `<resourceareas>` block **directly under
the sector component** (not a separate region object). **[OBS]** A live solid
area is richer than the game-file template — it carries a position and links
to the physical asteroids:

```xml
<component class="sector" macro="cluster_500_sector002_macro">
  …
  <resourceareas>
    <area id="[0x301a0]" yieldid="sphere_medium_nividium_verylow_veryfast"
          yield="381" starttime="0">
      <offset><position x="-30000" y="-10000" z="-130000"/></offset>
      <fields>
        <field region="[0x2ebaa]" macro="env_ast_niv_l_01_macro" weight="3076"/>
        <field region="[0x2ebb2]" macro="env_ast_niv_l_01_macro" weight="279485"/>
        …
      </fields>
    </area>
    …
  </resourceareas>
```

Attributes / children (all **[OBS]**):

- `yieldid` = `sphere_<boundary>_<ware>_<level>_<gatherspeed>`, e.g.
  `sphere_large_ore_high_slow` → boundary `large`, ware `ore`, level `high`,
  gatherspeed `slow`. Parse by structure, not a regex over the middle: the
  **boundary** token `medium` collides with the **level** token `medium`.
- `yield` = the area's **current** pool (depletes with mining). **Absent
  entirely when the area is depleted** — not `yield="0"`.
- `starttime` = `0` while the area holds resource; once depleted it becomes
  the **scheduled respawn time** (game-time seconds). See "starttime" below.
- `<offset><position>` = the area's real 3D location in the sector (metres).
  Present on **every** area, including depleted ones.
- `id` is a **runtime** id that remaps on every load — not a stable identity.
- No `respawndelay` attribute exists on save areas; the delay is resolved
  from the `yieldid`'s level via `regionyields.xml`.

**Gases vs solids differ structurally.** **[OBS]**

- **Gases** (helium, hydrogen, methane): position + yield only, **no
  `<fields>`** — they are gas clouds, no rocks to reference.
- **Solids** (ore, silicon, ice, nividium): a `<fields>` list linking the
  abstract deposit to the physical asteroid environment macros that render
  and get mined — `env_ast_ore_*`, `env_ast_crystal_*` (silicon is mined
  from *crystal* asteroids), `env_ast_ice_*`, `env_ast_niv_*`. Each `<field>`
  carries a `region="[0x…]"` (runtime id of the physical asteroid-field
  region) and a `weight`.

Two structural facts: **areas share physical regions** (one `region` id such
as `[0x2ebb2]` appears in the `<fields>` of ore, silicon, ice *and* nividium
areas — the `<area>` layer is accounting, the `region`/`macro` layer is the
rocks), and **depletion is representational, not structural** — a mined-out
area keeps its `<offset>` and `<fields>`, just drops `yield` and gains a
`starttime`.

### `starttime` = the respawn-*eligibility* time (not the depletion time, not when it fires)

Confirmed by the strongest available test: **every** depleted area whose
`starttime` is in the *future* is empty (42/42, across all wares), and no
depleted area has `starttime=0`. A depletion timestamp could never be in the
future, so `starttime` is the game-time at which this depleted area becomes
**eligible** to respawn (= depletion + `respawndelay`). **[OBS]** But
`starttime` is *not* when the respawn happens — an eligible area sits at zero
until a miner mines it (see the trigger section). An earlier draft read it as
the depletion time; that was wrong, and any "overdue" arithmetic built on
`now − respawndelay` with it is void. "Past-due / eligible" is simply
`starttime < game_time`; "not yet eligible" is `starttime > game_time`.

## Life cycle of an area

1. Area sits at some current `yield` ≤ capacity. **[DOC/OBS]**
2. Miners extract; gatherspeed `factor` scales extraction speed. Current
   `yield` falls. **[DOC]** (gatherspeed's exact effect on rate is [INF].)
3. A partially-mined area **does not refill** — no gradual regeneration.
   **[OBS]** Directly observed: Saturn 2's two mined-down `huge_silicon` areas
   stayed byte-identical while a depleted neighbour materialized full, and the
   partial nividium areas at Avarice / Third Redemption (381, 402) held fixed
   values across 4+ saves. (The XSD's "after it was **depleted**" wording
   independently implies it: a pool only comes back via whole-area respawn on
   *full* depletion, never partially.)
4. On full depletion the area drops its `yield` and is stamped with a
   `starttime` = **now + `respawndelay` minutes**, its respawn-eligibility
   time. It keeps its position and `<fields>`. **[OBS]**
5. Past `starttime` the area is **respawned** — the ore is back, full, and
   mineable (the encyclopedia shows it at capacity). But its *stored* `yield`
   lazily stays at 0 until a miner **actually mines it**, at which point the
   value materializes to full and the miner extracts. **[EXP]** — the Pious
   Mists XI experiment (below) caught exactly this: an area 1 h past `starttime`
   read 0 in the save until a Drill reached it, then materialized to its full
   5,000 cap with the miner pulling 980 out in the same instant. Saturn 2's
   `0 → 998,453` silicon materialization is the same event from the NPC-miner
   side.
6. `respawndelay = -1` disables respawn entirely. **[DOC]**

## What this predicts, and what we observed

### Unmined sectors are frozen — confirmed

No mining → nothing depletes → no respawn is ever scheduled → the field never
changes. **[OBS]** The Unknown System (no miners, one construction site) held
its ore pools byte-identical across 11 saves spanning 4.6 game-hours, sitting
at 32–70% of capacity the whole time (so not "frozen because full"). This is
about *mining*, not attention (below): with nothing depleting the areas,
there is simply nothing to respawn.

### Hard-mined ore fields show discrete respawn jumps — observed

Sectors mined hard enough to deplete small areas show a smooth
partial-depletion decline punctuated by discrete up-jumps (respawns).
**[OBS]** Clean in-window examples:

- Emperor's Pride VI ore: steady decline with a +15,151 jump (17.21→17.80h).
- Matrix #598 ore: decline with a +8,649 jump.
- Saturn 2 silicon: +969,919 in 0.22h, verified to land in the **same 6
  areas** (identical count and class mix) — a genuine refill/respawn, not
  newly-scanned areas.
- cluster_29 ore: 185,904 → 1,164,322 in 0.8h.

The respawn cadence — sparse, large jumps hours apart — is itself evidence
that `respawndelay` is **minutes, not seconds**: second-scale delays would
make fields refill almost continuously, which is not what we see. **[OBS]**

### Individual areas ARE trackable across saves — by position

The area `id` (`[0x…]`) is a runtime id and remaps on every load, so it is
**not** a stable key. But the area's `<offset><position>` **is** stable — it
persists unchanged through mining, full depletion, and respawn — so an
individual area can be followed across saves by **(position, yieldid)**.
**[OBS]** We did this repeatedly: the Asteroid Belt's two permanently-0 ore
areas held km(−250, −50) and (−130, 230) across 5 saves; Avarice's and Third
Redemption's nividium areas held their spots; and the Pious Mists XI area
materialized to full **in place** at (30, 70). Areas do not relocate on
respawn (this corrects an earlier note that claimed only the (sector, ware)
total was trackable — that was written before we started tracking by position
and is superseded). The per-(sector, ware) aggregate is still convenient for
sector-level trends, but it is a *choice*, not a limitation.

### Scrap looks frozen for the same reason as unmined sectors — reframed

`rawscrap` and `rawkhaakscrap` have the **same** respawndelay values as ore
(20–180 min), **not** -1, and no per-area override exists in the save. **[OBS]**
Across all 13 saves, scrap was never observed to respawn — but scrap was
also **never observed to deplete**: the big scrap fields never fell below
66–78% of their own max, and even the most-drawn-down (Silent Witness XII
khaak scrap at ~4% of cap) sat flat without hitting zero. **[OBS]**

So scrap's flatness is consistent with the general rule (slow collection →
no full depletion → no respawn), but whether scrap actually respawns when
depleted is **[UNVERIFIED]** — we have zero observations of the triggering
condition. Its other source, combat debris from destroyed ships, is a
separate mechanic and was minor in this playthrough (one +799 event in the
HQ combat sector). **[OBS]**

### The stored yield materializes when a miner mines the area — CONFIRMED by experiment

Past its `starttime` the area's ore is back and mineable (the encyclopedia
shows it at capacity), but the **stored `yield` stays 0** until a **miner
mines that specific area** — at which point the value materializes to full
and the miner extracts. It never materializes on a timer, at any attention
level. This was settled by a controlled in-game experiment.

**The Pious Mists XI experiment** **[EXP]**

- **Baseline** (save_008, 18.55h): the sector's two nividium areas both stored
  **0**. One at (30, 70) km was **eligible** — 0.9 h past its `starttime`; the
  other at (70, −50) km was **not yet eligible** (`starttime` ~0.5 h ahead).
  The encyclopedia showed **5,000** — i.e. only the eligible area's capacity
  (see the encyclopedia note), signalling the ore *was* there to be mined.
- **Action**: sent a player Drill on local automine for nividium; it flew in
  (the encyclopedia's live "mineable now" figure sent it there) and began
  mining. The eligible area's stored value stayed 0 for the whole flight —
  presence alone materialized nothing.
- **Result** (save_009, 18.76h): the **eligible** area (30, 70) now stored a
  live **4,020**, and the Drill's hold held **980** nividium. 4,020 + 980 =
  **5,000** = the medium nividium capacity: it materialized to full the instant
  the miner made contact, and the miner immediately pulled 980 out. The
  **not-yet-eligible** area (70, −50) stayed at 0 (correct — not yet respawned,
  and the miner wasn't on it).

So the stored value materializes on two conditions: the area past its
`starttime` (respawned/available) **and** a miner making mining contact.
Attention/presence is irrelevant except insofar as it lets a miner reach the
area. This is a **lazy, on-mining-contact** materialization, per area.

**This resolves the whole "why do saves show empty fields" backlog.** At
18.52h there were 145 eligible areas storing 0 — not stuck, not rate-limited;
their ore was available, the *stored* value just hadn't been materialized
because no miner had mined them since eligibility. Every earlier hypothesis
in this investigation was wrong and is superseded:

- ~~needs high attention~~ — Saturn 2 materialized with no player near (its NPC
  miners did it); Third Redemption stayed at 0 *with* the player in-sector.
- ~~needs a background timer / low-attention tick~~ — an area sat 1 h+ past
  eligibility storing 0 until a miner touched it.
- ~~rate-limited execution~~ — the "backlog" is areas no miner has mined; it
  clears one area at a time, on contact, not by a throttled queue.

It also explains the two **permanently-0** areas in the heavily-mined Asteroid
Belt (same fixed positions, stored 0 across 5 saves for 16 h while 11
neighbours cycled): the miner AI simply never paths to those two physical
spots, so nothing ever makes contact and their stored value never materializes.
Idle fields (Avarice, Third Redemption nividium) store 0 indefinitely for the
same reason — no miner works them.

### Aside: the encyclopedia is a live rendering of what's mineable NOW

The map/encyclopedia resource figures are not template capacities and not the
raw stored yields — they are a **live rendering of what is actually mineable
in the sector right now**, computed **per area**:

- a partially-mined area contributes its **live `yield`**;
- an **empty area past its respawn timer (eligible)** contributes its **full
  capacity** — because it *will* respawn to that the moment a miner touches it;
- an **empty area not yet eligible** contributes **0**.

**[OBS]** Verified: Third Redemption's ore 116k / ice 155k / methane 259k
matched the summed live yields to the digit (all partial areas), and its
overdue nividium showed 500 (one eligible-empty area at cap). The clincher is
Pious Mists XI — **two** empty medium nividium areas (5,000 cap each), yet the
encyclopedia showed **5,000, not 10,000**: only the **eligible** area was
counted at full; the not-yet-eligible one contributed **0**.

So the figure is exactly **"how much a miner could pull right now"** — live
resource plus eligible areas that respawn on contact — and it is **accurate**,
not a fudge. A genuinely-full area and an eligible-empty area are functionally
identical: both yield the full capacity when mined, which is why a mining ship
flies to either with equal confidence and succeeds (the eligible one respawns
on arrival — exactly what the Pious Mists XI Drill did). The distinction
matters only to **our** save-reading: an eligible-empty area is stored at
`yield`=0, so summing raw yields **understates** what's actually mineable. To
reproduce the game's honest "mineable now" figure, a tool must add each
empty-but-eligible area at its **full capacity**, not count it as 0.

## Rates and "extraction" — what the numbers do and don't mean

- `cap / respawndelay` is **not** a continuous regeneration rate.
  `respawndelay` is a post-depletion cooldown (in minutes), not a rate
  denominator, so any per-hour figure built from it is dimensionally
  meaningless. **[DOC-derived]** (An earlier version of the map gauge
  computed exactly this; it is being reworked — see
  [resource-extraction-plan.md](resource-extraction-plan.md).)
- The **respawn-throughput ceiling** (whole areas returning every
  respawndelay) is enormous — far above any real mining fleet. In every
  sector studied the binding limit on sustainable extraction was the
  **mining fleet**, not respawn. **[INF from OBS].**
- Because respawn is **on-mining-contact**, a field only *produces while a
  miner is actively on it*. A single continuously-mined area cycles at its
  own ceiling (mine to 0 → wait `respawndelay` → miner contact respawns it
  full → repeat = `cap / respawndelay`). A field's realized output is the sum
  over just the areas miners actually touch — which is why big fields never
  cycle all their areas (miners work a subset) and idle fields produce zero
  regardless of what they "contain." **[EXP-derived].**
- Realized replenishment is only visible as **respawn events**, and
  concurrent mining masks much of it, so any measured rate from save
  history is a **lower bound** on true sustainable extraction — except in
  sectors stable or rising under heavy load, where it approaches the true
  maximum. **[OBS/INF].**

Measured fields (mining ≈ fleet-limited, replenish ≈ observed respawns):

| field · ware | fill | net decline | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Emperor's Pride VI ore | 32% | −36k/h | 31 miners; +15k respawn blip; est. replenish ~45k/h |
| Matrix #451 ore | 55% | −16.7k/h | 5 miners; replenish ~0–3k/h |
| Matrix #9 ore | 45% | −42.8k/h | 60 areas, 25 miners; replenish ~37k/h |
| Matrix #598 ore | 42% | −48.8k/h | 60 areas, 24 miners; +8.6k blip; replenish ~28k/h |
| Asteroid Belt silicon | 66% | −71k/h | 60 miners; declines faster than any static ceiling |
| Saturn 2 silicon | 29% | **+145k/h** | 71 miners; ≥233k/h gross respawn (rising under load) |

(Replenish estimates use an imported ~3,200 ore/h-per-M-miner rate,
calibrated at Emperor's Pride and cross-checked against the respawn blips;
they are estimates, not direct measurements.)

## Open questions (unverified)

1. ~~Does a respawn restore full capacity?~~ **RESOLVED — yes.** Saturn 2
   silicon 0 → 998,453 (99.8%); Pious Mists XI nividium respawned to its
   full 5,000 cap on miner contact. Respawn brings a fresh full area.
2. ~~Why do eligible areas not respawn — rate limit? attention?~~ **RESOLVED
   — respawn fires on a miner mining the area** (Pious Mists XI experiment).
   Not a timer, not attention, not a throttle. The "overdue backlog" is just
   areas no miner has touched since becoming eligible.
3. **What exactly does gatherspeed scale** — mining extraction rate,
   respawn amount, or both? Assumed extraction rate only. **[INF]**
4. ~~Does depletion require exactly 0 to arm the timer?~~ **~Yes — arms at
   true empty.** **[INF, strongly supported]** Across all 3,306 areas in the
   save, **zero** nonzero-yield areas carry a *future* (actively counting-down)
   `starttime`; every active eligibility timer is on an **empty** area. The 204
   nonzero areas with a *past* `starttime` are stale leftovers (armed at a
   prior full depletion, re-materialized by mining, timer uncleared). A
   nonzero threshold would leave areas mid-countdown *with* resource — none
   exist. So the timer arms only when the area hits 0.
5. **Does scrap respawn when depleted?** Never observed depleted, but **[INF —
   probably yes]**: `rawscrap`/`rawkhaakscrap` carry the same `respawndelay`
   values and identical `<area>`/`<fields>` structure as other solids, and
   nothing distinguishes them mechanically. No reason to expect different
   behaviour; only never triggered (scrap is collected too slowly to fully
   deplete an area). Would be *confirmed* by mining one scrap field to zero
   and sending a miner back.
6. **What decides which areas a miner AI touches?** This governs which areas
   ever respawn. **Not gatherspeed** **[OBS]**: the Asteroid Belt's two
   permanently-0 areas are `medium/fast` and `high/average` — *better* than
   the two `veryhigh/slow` areas that cycle fine there. Both dead areas sit at
   the sector's spatial **periphery** (km(−250, −50) far −x edge; (−130, 230)
   isolated corner), so the driver looks like **position / pathing** (proximity
   to stations and the miners' working cluster), not field quality. The exact
   selection logic is engine-side and unquantified.

## Appendix A — a complete ore-field definition, end to end

The full definition of a sector's ore is spread across three files that
reference each other. Worked example: **Cluster_01_Sector001** (the ore
part of its `<resourceareas>`).

### Step 1 — `mapdefaults.xml` places the areas in the sector

Under the sector macro's `<properties><resourceareas>`, each `<resourcearea>`
row says *how many* areas of a given template to spawn (`amount`) and *which*
template (`ref`):

```xml
<resourceareas>
  ...
  <resourcearea amount="4" ref="sphere_large_ore_high_slow" />
  <resourcearea amount="4" ref="sphere_small_ore_medium_average" />
  <resourcearea amount="4" ref="sphere_tiny_ore_low_fast" />
  ...
</resourceareas>
```

So this sector gets **12 ore areas**: four of each of three kinds.

### Step 2 — decode each `ref`

`ref = sphere_<boundary>_<ware>_<level>_<gatherspeed>`:

| ref | boundary | ware | level | gatherspeed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `sphere_large_ore_high_slow` | large | ore | high | slow |
| `sphere_small_ore_medium_average` | small | ore | medium | average |
| `sphere_tiny_ore_low_fast` | tiny | ore | low | fast |

### Step 3 — resolve the templates from `regionyields.xml`

Each token is a lookup into `regionyields.xml`:

- **boundary** → physical size (radius):
  `tiny r=20 km · small r=30 km · medium r=50 km · large r=100 km · huge r=200 km`
- **level** → per-ware capacity + respawndelay (from the `<yield>` blocks):
  `low` ore = 50,000 cap / 40 min · `medium` = 200,000 / 60 min ·
  `high` = 1,000,000 / 120 min
- **gatherspeed** → extraction-speed factor:
  `fast` = ×2.0 · `average` = ×1.0 · `slow` = ×0.5

### Step 4 — the resulting field

Putting it together, Cluster_01_Sector001's ore field is:

| kind | count | radius | capacity each | respawndelay | gather ×  | subtotal cap |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| large / high / slow | 4 | 100 km | 1,000,000 | 120 min | 0.5 | 4,000,000 |
| small / medium / average | 4 | 30 km | 200,000 | 60 min | 1.0 | 800,000 |
| tiny / low / fast | 4 | 20 km | 50,000 | 40 min | 2.0 | 200,000 |
| **total** | **12** | | | | | **5,000,000** |

So "the ore in this sector" is 12 discrete asteroid areas totalling 5 M ore
at full capacity — a few big slow-to-respawn fields plus many small fast ones.

### Step 5 — how it looks live in a save

At runtime the sector's areas live in a flat `<resourceareas>` block under the
sector component. Each is an `<area>` with a remapped runtime id, a current
`yield`, a 3D `<offset><position>`, and — for solids — a `<fields>` list
linking to the physical asteroid macros that render and get mined:

```xml
<area id="[0x3018d]" yieldid="sphere_large_ore_high_slow" yield="53658" starttime="0">
  <offset><position x="-50000" y="-10000" z="-270000"/></offset>
  <fields>
    <field region="[0x2ebb2]" macro="env_ast_ore_xl_01_macro" weight="1190732"/>
    …
  </fields>
</area>
```

Here a `large/high/slow` area (1 M capacity) is nearly mined out at 53,658.
The save stores per area only the current `yield`, the `yieldid`, the
position, and the asteroid-field links; capacity, respawndelay, radius and
gather factor are all resolved back through `regionyields.xml`.

When it hits zero the `yield` attribute **disappears** and `starttime` is set
to the respawn-eligibility time (depletion + 120 min). The `<offset>` and
`<fields>` stay — depletion is representational, not structural. After that
time it is *eligible* but stays empty until a **miner mines it**, at which
point it respawns full (see the respawn-trigger section).

Gases (helium/hydrogen/methane) have **no `<fields>`** — just position and
yield — because there are no rocks; silicon's fields point at `env_ast_crystal_*`
(crystal asteroids), ice at `env_ast_ice_*`, nividium at `env_ast_niv_*`.
One physical `region` id is shared across the ore/silicon/ice/nividium areas
that coexist in the same field.

## Appendix B — one-pager

**The rule:** resources deplete under mining and never refill gradually. A
depleted area **respawns whole and full** `respawndelay` minutes later — the
ore is genuinely back and mineable then (the encyclopedia shows it). But the
save's *stored* `yield` lazily reads **0** until a miner actually mines the
area, which materializes the value. So a respawned area **is** full; the field
value just doesn't show it until touched.

**Life cycle of one area**

```

The respawn (availability) happens on the `respawndelay` timer; only the
**stored `yield`** waits for a miner's contact to catch up. In the save a
respawned-but-untouched area has no `yield` attribute and a past `starttime`;
it keeps its `<offset><position>` and `<fields>`.

**A "field" is a bag of independent areas.** A sector's ore is ~12 separate
asteroid areas of mixed size/level/speed, each with its own pool, position,
and respawn state. Everything is per-area, and respawn is evaluated per-area
on contact — so a field only produces from the areas miners actually touch.

**The numbers** (`regionyields.xml`, per area; ore/silicon/ice share these):

| level | capacity | respawndelay |
|---|---:|---:|
| verylow | 5,000 | 20 min |
| low | 50,000 | 40 min |
| medium | 200,000 | 60 min |
| high | 1,000,000 | 120 min |
| veryhigh | 2,000,000 | 180 min |

(Nividium is far smaller: 500 → 50,000 cap, 90 → 480 min delay.) Gatherspeed
scales *mining* rate: veryslow ×0.2 · slow ×0.5 · average ×1.0 · fast ×2.0 ·
veryfast ×5.0. `respawndelay = -1` = never respawns.

**What follows from the rule**

- **No miner → the stored `yield` stays 0** (but the ore *did* respawn on the
  timer and is mineable — the encyclopedia shows it). Two distinct cases:
  areas that **never deplete** (unmined sectors, slowly-collected scrap) hold
  their stored value and never enter the cycle; areas **mined to 0** respawn on
  schedule but their stored value only **materializes when a miner mines them**.
  The Asteroid Belt has two ore areas *storing* 0 for 16 h+ while 11 neighbours
  cycle — the miner AI never paths to those two spots, so their value never
  materializes, though a miner sent there would find full ore.
- **Respawn works with no player present** — NPC miners trigger it (Saturn 2
  silicon respawned while the player only remote-scouted).
- **Confirmed by experiment**: an area 1 h past `starttime`, empty, respawned
  to its full 5,000 the instant a player Drill mined it — which took 980 in the
  same moment (4,020 left). Presence alone did nothing until mining contact.
- **The encyclopedia is a live rendering of what's *mineable now*** — live
  yields of partial areas + empty-but-eligible areas at full capacity (they
  respawn on contact); not-yet-eligible empty areas count 0. Pious Mists XI's
  two empty nividium areas showed **5,000, not 10,000** — only the eligible
  one counted. It's accurate: a full area and an eligible-empty area both mine
  out full. The implication runs the *other* way — summing raw save `yield`s
  **understates** mineability, so a "mineable now" tool must add
  empty-but-eligible areas at full capacity.
- **Individual areas are trackable across saves by position** — the `<area>`
  `id` remaps on load, but the `<offset><position>` is stable through
  depletion and respawn (areas materialize **in place**, they don't relocate).
  Track by (position, yieldid); the per-(sector, ware) total is a convenience,
  not the only option.

**Consequences for measuring "extraction"**

- `cap ÷ respawndelay` is **not** a live rate; it's the ceiling a *single
  continuously-mined* area could sustain (mine→wait→contact-respawn→repeat).
- A field's real output = sum over only the areas miners contact; big fields
  never cycle all areas, idle fields produce nothing regardless of contents.
- The binding limit on sustainable extraction is the **mining fleet** (which
  areas it touches and how fast), never respawn throughput.

**Mostly settled:** the timer arms at true empty (no nonzero area ever shows an
active countdown); scrap almost certainly respawns like everything else (same
delays/structure, just never depleted); and which areas respawn is gated by
**which areas a miner paths to** — driven by position, *not* gatherspeed (the
Asteroid Belt's two dead areas are `fast`/`average`, better than the `slow`
ones that cycle). **Still open:** whether gatherspeed touches respawn *amount*,
and the exact miner-AI area-selection logic.

## One-line summary

Resources deplete under mining and never refill gradually; a depleted area
respawns **whole and full only when a miner mines it**, once past its
`respawndelay` — so replenishment is contact-driven and per-area, untouched
fields stay at zero indefinitely, and a sector produces only from the areas
miners actually work.
